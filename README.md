# pdf-query-retrieval-system

This project demonstrates a system for efficiently querying and retrieving specific information from PDF documents. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) and search techniques, it enables users to perform accurate queries on a collection of PDFs.

## Features

- **Efficient Query Processing**: Search for specific content across multiple PDF files.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Extract and understand the context of your queries.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for inputting queries and viewing results.

## Requirements

### Software:
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (install via `requirements.txt`):
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Project Files

- **`pdf-query-retrieval-system.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook for running the query retrieval system.
- **`requirements.txt`**: File containing the list of required Python libraries.
- **`pdfs/`**: Folder to store the PDF files to be queried.

## How It Works

### Query Execution:

1. The user places PDF files in the `pdfs/` folder.
2. A query is entered in the Jupyter Notebook.
3. The system processes the query using NLP techniques and retrieves relevant information from the PDFs.

### Results Display:

- The retrieved results are displayed within the notebook for easy access and review.

## Steps to Run

### Setup:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pdf-query-retrieval-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd pdf-query-retrieval-system
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Run the System:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook pdf-query-retrieval-system.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to input your query and retrieve results.
